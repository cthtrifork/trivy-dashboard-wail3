# Releasing

## Cut a release

**Actions → Tag and release → Run workflow** (on `main`), or from a terminal:

```sh
gh workflow run tag-release.yml                    # next version, from the merged PR titles
gh workflow run tag-release.yml -f bump=minor      # next minor version
gh workflow run tag-release.yml -f tag=v1.0.0      # an exact tag
```

Give **either** an exact tag **or** a bump:

| Input | Effect |
|---|---|
| `tag` (text) | Use exactly this tag: `v1.4.0` or `v1.4.0-rc.1`. When filled in, it wins over `bump`. |
| `bump` (`auto` / `patch` / `minor` / `major`, default `auto`) | `auto` uses the version Release Drafter works out from the PRs merged since the last release: a breaking change (`!`) is a major, a `feat` a minor, anything else a patch ([Release notes](#release-notes)). The others increase that part of the highest **stable** `vX.Y.Z` tag, resetting the lower parts. |

With no tags yet the base is `v0.0.0`: `minor` gives `v0.1.0`, `major` gives `v1.0.0`, `patch` gives `v0.0.1`.
Pre-releases and tags that are not `vX.Y.Z` are ignored when working out the base, so `v2.0.0-rc.1` does not make
the next `minor` become `v2.1.0`.

The workflow then:

1. refuses to run anywhere but `main`;
2. works out the tag (Release Drafter for `auto`, otherwise `scripts/next-version.sh`) and stops if a published **release** for it already exists (the draft Release Drafter keeps does not count);
3. creates an annotated tag on the head of `main` and pushes it, unless the tag already exists (see *Retrying*);
4. calls `release.yml` for that tag, which re-runs vet, tests and `govulncheck` (in a `checks` job beside the binary build, not before it), builds the binary, and publishes the
   release (the draft Release Drafter wrote for that tag, with the assets attached) (binary, tarball, signed `.deb` and `.rpm`, public key, CycloneDX SBOM, `SHA256SUMS`) and signed attestations. See [self-update](self-update.md) for why those assets
   have the names they do. The same run also pushes the headless container image to
   `ghcr.io/cthtrifork/trivy-dashboard-wail3` (tags `1.2.3`, `v1.2.3`, and `latest` for a final release) with a signed
   provenance attestation; see [headless](headless.md). The image is only pushed for a tagged release, never from a
   branch or a dry run, and only once `checks` has passed. It builds beside the binary, so a failure in the binary job
   (for example a missing signing key) does not stop the image from being pushed; the GitHub release is only created
   when both finish.

## Release notes

[Release Drafter](https://github.com/release-drafter/release-drafter) writes the notes and works out the next version, from one config, [`.github/release-drafter.yml`](../.github/release-drafter.yml). Nobody tags PRs or edits notes by hand: a PR title is all it needs.

**Title: `type(scope)!: summary`** ([Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)). The `scope` and `!` are optional. Write the effect a user sees (`fix: keep the last scan on disk across a restart`), not the diff (`fix: change persist.go`). Squash merges use the title as the commit subject, so the history reads the same way. In the notes the `type(scope):` prefix is dropped and the first letter capitalised, because the section already says what kind of change it is.

| Type | Release-note section | Label | Next version |
|---|---|---|---|
| any type with `!` | Breaking changes (first) | `breaking-change` | major |
| `security` | Security | `security` | patch |
| `feat` | New features | `feature` | minor |
| `fix` | Bug fixes | `bug` | patch |
| `perf` | Performance | `performance` | patch |
| `docs` | Documentation | `documentation` | patch |
| `deps` | Dependencies (collapsed after 5) | `dependencies` | patch |
| `ci`, `build` | CI, build and release | `ci`, `build` | patch |
| `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, `revert` | Maintenance | `maintenance` (`refactor` also `refactor`) | patch |
| anything else | Other changes | none | patch |

A PR is listed once, in the first section it matches (title type, or the label as an override). The next version is the highest increment among the merged PRs. A PR labelled `skip-changelog` is left out of both the notes and the version.

**How it fits the release flow**

1. *Release Drafter* (`release-drafter.yml`) runs on every push to `main` and keeps a **draft release** current: a preview of the next notes and version. Nothing is published from it. Open the repository's Releases page to read it before cutting a release.
2. *Tag and release* with `bump` = `auto` (the default) tags the version Release Drafter resolved. An explicit `tag`, or `patch` / `minor` / `major`, still wins; then Release Drafter is only asked for the notes.
3. `release.yml` asks Release Drafter for the notes of exactly that tag (`tag`, and `commitish` = the tag, so the list ends at the tagged commit), uploads the build to that draft, checks the tag exists, then publishes the draft with the notes written again from the same run, so a push to `main` while the assets uploaded cannot change them. A retry deletes the draft's assets first and uploads again.

**Enforcement.** The *PR title* workflow (`pr-title.yml`) fails a PR whose title does not match (`amannn/action-semantic-pull-request`) and sets the label from the type (Release Drafter's autolabeler, `autolabeler` in the same config; with `sync-labels` it also removes a stale label when the title is edited and creates a label that does not exist yet). The labels are for filtering and as a manual override: the notes and the version read the title, so a missing label does not misfile a PR. Fork PRs are checked but not labelled (the token is read-only). The `bot/*` screenshots preview PR is skipped. Renovate PRs are titled `deps: update ...`, or `security: ...` for vulnerability fixes (`semanticCommits` in `renovate.json5`), so they get the same sections and labels. To make the check block merging, add **check title** as a required status check in the branch rules (repository settings; not something a workflow can do).

When you change a type or section, change the `types` in `pr-title.yml`, the categories and autolabeler rules in `.github/release-drafter.yml`, and the table above together.

**Limits.** Release Drafter finds the last release from the published releases, not the tags, so a tag that was never released does not move the base version. A non-conventional title (a PR opened before this convention, or by someone who ignored the check) lands in *Other changes* as a patch.

## One-time setup: the package signing key

The `.deb` and `.rpm` are signed with a PGP key kept in two repository secrets (Settings → Secrets and variables →
Actions). A release **fails without the key**; a dry run on a branch builds unsigned packages.

```sh
gpg --quick-gen-key 'Trivy Scanner releases <you@example.com>' rsa4096 sign 2y
gpg --armor --export-secret-keys <fingerprint>        # -> secret RELEASE_GPG_PRIVATE_KEY
# the key's passphrase                                 # -> secret RELEASE_GPG_PASSPHRASE (omit for no passphrase)
```

Use a key made only for this. The workflow exports the matching public key as `trivy-scanner-release-key.asc` on every
release and prints its fingerprint in the log, so publish the fingerprint somewhere users can cross-check it (the README
is a good place). Rotating the key means updating the secrets; users import the new public key.

## Packages

`scripts/package-linux.sh` runs `wails3 tool package` (nfpm) with `build/linux/nfpm/nfpm.yaml`. They install the
binary to `/usr/bin/trivy-scanner`, the launcher `build/linux/trivy-scanner.desktop` (category Security, startup
notification, `StartupWMClass=trivy-scanner`, matching `ProgramName` in `main.go`) and the icon in hicolor (256px PNG
and scalable SVG). Dependencies are `libgtk-4-1` and `libwebkitgtk-6.0-4` (`gtk4`, `webkitgtk6.0` for the rpm), and
podman is recommended. The packages are built from the Ubuntu 24.04 binary, so the Fedora package needs a Fedora with
WebKitGTK 6 and a glibc that new. Try it locally with a built binary: `make wails3-install` then
`scripts/package-linux.sh <binary> v1.2.3 dist` (set `PKG_SIGNING_KEY_FILE` and `NFPM_PASSPHRASE` to sign).

## Retrying

If the tag was created but the release failed (a flaky step, a vulnerability that needed fixing first), run
**Tag and release** again with that **exact tag** in `tag` (not `auto`: the draft's version may have moved on). A tag that exists without a release is reused, not moved, so
the run finishes the release for the commit that was tagged. If you instead need the fix in the release, delete the tag
(`git push origin :refs/tags/v1.2.3`) and run again.

## Why the release is called, not triggered

Pushing a tag normally triggers `release.yml`, and still does when you push one from your own machine. A tag pushed by a
workflow using its own `GITHUB_TOKEN` does **not** trigger other workflows (GitHub prevents workflows from starting each
other that way). So *Tag and release* calls `release.yml` directly after creating the tag. The alternative is a personal
access token or a GitHub App, which would work but adds a long-lived secret.

## Notes

- Only one *Tag and release* run happens at a time, so two runs cannot pick the same next version.
- The release is built from the **tag**, not from whatever `main` has become by then, and `release.yml` still checks the
  tagged commit is on `main`.
- Running `release.yml` by hand on a branch is still a dry run that builds but does not publish. Dispatched on a tag it
  publishes, which is another way to retry.
- **Not run on GitHub yet.** The scripts and the workflow steps' shell are tested here (see `internal/release`), and
  `actionlint` validates the reusable-workflow wiring, but the first real run is the first end-to-end.

## Verifying a release

The release job signs a SLSA build-provenance attestation for the binary, tarball and SBOM, and an SBOM attestation for
the binary, then verifies them itself before creating the release. To check a download by hand:

```sh
gh attestation verify trivy-scanner_linux_amd64 --repo cthtrifork/trivy-dashboard-wail3
gh attestation verify trivy-scanner_linux_amd64 --repo cthtrifork/trivy-dashboard-wail3 \
  --predicate-type https://cyclonedx.org/bom
```

The packages are also signed with the release PGP key. Import `trivy-scanner-release-key.asc` from the release, check
its fingerprint, then:

```sh
# rpm: rpmkeys --import checks the signature from now on, even with plain rpm/dnf
sudo rpmkeys --import trivy-scanner-release-key.asc
rpm --checksig trivy-scanner_<version>_x86_64.rpm

# deb: the signature is an origin signature inside the .deb (_gpgorigin), checked with debsig-verify
# or by hand; apt itself does not check it for a file installed with `apt install ./x.deb`.
ar p trivy-scanner_<version>_amd64.deb debian-binary control.tar.gz data.tar.gz > payload
ar p trivy-scanner_<version>_amd64.deb _gpgorigin > payload.sig
gpg --import trivy-scanner-release-key.asc && gpg --verify payload.sig payload
```

The SBOM (`trivy-scanner_<version>.sbom.cdx.json`) lists the Go modules and npm packages the binary is built from (from `go.mod` and `frontend/package-lock.json`), generated with Trivy (`format: cyclonedx`).
It has no os/arch in its name so the in-app updater never considers it as the binary.
